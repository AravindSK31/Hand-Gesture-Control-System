# Hand Gesture Control System

This project utilizes MediaPipe, OpenCV, and YOLO for real-time hand gesture recognition to control system functions such as brightness, volume, and browser tabs. By tracking hand landmarks, specific gestures are mapped to actions, enabling a seamless and intuitive human-computer interaction experience.

## Features

- **Brightness Control**: Increase or decrease screen brightness with simple hand gestures.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the system volume up or down using specific finger positions.
- **Tab Management**: Switch between browser tabs or close the current tab with predefined gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses MediaPipe for efficient hand landmark detection and tracking in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Visual feedback is provided to the user, displaying detected gestures and corresponding actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **YOLO**
- **PyAutoGUI**
- **Screen Brightness Control**
- **PyCaw**
